# JS-Quiz

The Goal of this project was to create a Quiz using JavaScript fundamentals and store the high scores.

When I open the index.html and the Start Quiz button is clicked, then i am presented with a question and several options to choose the correct answer, when a question is answered then i am presented with another question until all the questions are answered. If a question is answered incorrectly then the time is substracted from the clock until the timer reaches 0, then the game is over.
When the game is over, the player can save their name and score in a Highscores table.
